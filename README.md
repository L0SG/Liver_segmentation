# Liver_segmentation
Pixel-wise liver segmentation from CT image in PyTorch

This repo uses in-house industrial CT dataset, so codes for data loading is little nasty and i cannot release the dataset. But structures of the data is nearly identical to 3Dircadb (http://www.ircad.fr/research/3dircadb/).

Assumes 512x512 slices of dicom CT images and their corresponding binary segmentation masks.
